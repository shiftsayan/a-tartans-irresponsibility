# A Tartan's Irresponsibility

This is a Python script to automatically fill in my default responses to Carnegie Mellon University's Student Daily Self-Assessment while I am on winter break. This will be run manually every morning if my responses haven't changed from my default responses. This does not have 2FA support so I need to approve the push notification every time I run it.
## Requirements

* `selenium` with [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
